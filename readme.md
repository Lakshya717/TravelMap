# College TravelMap
A real time social map and travel hub for college, showing where everyone is, and what's happening. Students can create travel plans, find groups, and coordinate meetups through live map.

## About The Project

- it is a dynamic, **social mapping application** designed for specifically for college students.

- Many students travel long distances between their homes and college at the beginning and end **every semester**. This application simplifies the coordination of these journeys. It helps students find groups or co-travelers, share rides between cities, and see where other students of the college are while in transit. 

- Instead of relying on disconnected group chats, students can **create**, **share**, and **join** travel plans **directly on a live map**, making it easy to form groups, share rides, and meet up.
